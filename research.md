# Collisions
- "nearly" elastic (recall: elastic means momentum is entirely transferred)
- At impact...
    - target ball travels along contact point
    - cue ball travels perpendicular to target ball
    - **2 edge cases?**
        - when angle is near 90degrees, obliqueness of shot affects transferred velocity
        - when angle is 0 (straight-on shot), momentum completely transferred

# Nonideal considerations
- friction of pool table
- "restitution" of ball-ball, ball-rail 

# Physical characteristics
- Mass of ball = (0.15kg)[https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/OluwoleOwoseni.shtml]
- Mass of cue stick ~ (19oz = 0.538641kg)
- Friction coefficient
- Cushion
